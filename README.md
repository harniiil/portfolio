This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is built to present my skills, experience, and projects in network engineering, cloud infrastructure, and security, with a focus on clean design, reliability, and real-world engineering practices rather than visual noise.

I’m a network and cloud-focused engineer based in London, United Kingdom, with a strong security mindset. My work centers on designing, maintaining, and troubleshooting reliable systems, from on-prem networking to cloud infrastructure, with an emphasis on uptime, clear architecture, and secure defaults. This portfolio highlights hands-on networking and cloud experience, security-aware workflows, practical projects, and academic experience.

The portfolio is built using Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript, CSS Modules for scoped styling, Framer Motion for subtle scroll animations, and is deployed on Vercel with automatic redeployments on every push to the main branch.

Project structure is simple and intentional: `app/` contains pages and layouts, `components/` contains reusable UI components, `styles/` contains modular CSS files, and `public/` contains static assets such as images.

To run the project locally: clone the repository, install dependencies, and start the development server:

`git clone https://github.com/harniiil/portfolio.git`  
`cd portfolio`  
`npm install`  
`npm run dev`

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
